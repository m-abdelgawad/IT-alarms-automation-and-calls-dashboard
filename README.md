* Project Name: IT Alarms Automation & Calls Dashboard
* Version: v1.0.0

### Business Case
The "IT MOM Alarms Automation" project is a strategic 
initiative by IT Automation to enhance the reliability of 
critical IT systems.

The project's core goal is quick identification and 
resolution of critical alarms, achieving efficiency and 
customer satisfaction. Real-time notifications empower 
IT teams to promptly respond to alarms, minimizing 
disruptions.

The IT MOM Alarms and Calls Dashboard is a pivotal part of 
this initiative. It offers a view of the application 
health, revealing alarm patterns, call responses, and 
team performance. Key metrics, including received alarms, 
initiated calls, and call outcomes, empower decision-makers. 

Graphical displays aid in understanding system behavior 
and support proactive actions.
